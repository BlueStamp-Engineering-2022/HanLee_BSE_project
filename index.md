# Omnidirectional Robot

My project is to make a omnidirectional robot with three wheels that is controlled by a ps2 controller and Arduino. The robot uses special omni wheels that have rollers on the side of them allowing the the wheels to be pushed in way normal wheels cannot.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the Simon Says game. The game has four different colored buttons that you push in the order the game dictates. At first the game only asks you to push one button. Every time you get the button sequence correct, the game adds a new color to the sequence. This makes the game get harder over time. If you push the wrong button, you lose. I made the game by soldering the piecis in the kit together.

# Final Milestone

For my third milestone, I added a robotic claw to my robot and tried to increase the reliability. I made my robotic claw in cad and then 3d printed it. The claw is controlled by a servo and mounted to the robot with screws. One problem I ran into a lot was the robot would randomly spin two of the wheels without any input from my controller and it would not stop. I tried many things to fix this but it turned out it was a controller issue. To fix this, I switched my receiver for an extra one I had.

# Second Milestone

My second milestone involved assembling the robot base and coding the robot so that it can be controlled by a PS2 controller. To assemble the base I had to measure, bend, and cut metal brackets to mount by motors too. After I attached the motor mounts and motors I had to make wheel braces to prevent the wheel from falling out. My code made one joystick control the rotation of the robot and the other one controls the direction the robot moves.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was wiring up all the electronics and making a test code.This involved wiring the ps2 receiver to the arduino, wiring the motors to the motor drives, attaching the motor drivers to the arduino, powering the motor drivers with a battery, and powering the arduino with a battery. My simple test code spun the wheels one direction for three seconds then reversed them and spun them the other direction for three seconds
