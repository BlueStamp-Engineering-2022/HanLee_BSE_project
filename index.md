my project is to make a omnidirectional robot with 3 wheeles what is controled by a ps2 controler. The robot is powered by a arduino.

# starter project
My starter project was the simon says game. The game has four different colored buttons that you push in the order the game tells you to. At first the game only asks you to push one button. Every time you get the button combination correct, the game adds a new color to the sequence. This makes the game get harder over time. If you push the wrong button you lose. I made the game by soldering the pecies in the kit together.

# Second Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servoâ€™s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone is wiring up all the electronics and making a test code.This involved wiring the ps2 receiver to the arduino, wiring the motors to the motor drives, attaching the motor drivers to the arduino, powering the motor drivers with a battery, and powering the arduino with a battery.  My simple test code spins the wheels one direction for 3 seconds then reverses them and spins them the other direction for 3 seconds
